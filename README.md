# TrustedAutoRun
USB AutoRun based on security key.

Enable/execute AutoRun only on removable USB devices you trust. This application can run on start up in the background (minimized to tray) and detect when a new AutoRun enabled device is plugged in. If it set as a trusted device, the application will initiate/execute the defined AutoRun "open" action set on the device (AUTORUN.INF). Tested on Win7 and Win10.

This is still a work in progress. You trust/untrust the devices and "rawedit" or setup wizard (not working yet) to edit the AUTORUN.INF options.
